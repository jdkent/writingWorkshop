difficultly: placing concrete answers into 

conceptual impact: sharing ideas at an unprecedented rate


making an argument that is not overloaded is essential in grant applications

In a land dominated by vehicles that heave toxic fumes into the atmosphere, a challenger emerges that promises to transport us with efficiency and agility.
This challenger comes in the form of a two-wheeled person powered machine called a bicycle.
A bicycle is one of the most efficient methods of transportation.
The two wheeled structure may appear unstable at first, but once momentum is achieved, the ability for the bicycle to remain upright is astounding.
How do we achive momentum? By placing our feet on the peddles and applying force.
Truly, the bicylcle is a wonder of creation that promises a better earth.

specific aims
Things not to do: don't make it yes or no, ask a how question. But it has to be bounded within the field so that it isn't too open ended.


what is the optimal relative sizes of the wheels?

how does changing the gear impact the relationship between the peddle and the chain?
a. sub-aim: the first sentence after the title of a sub-aim is to lead into the conceptual framework.


Presentation: priming questions, this raises the the following possibilities,
then walk through the conditional structure of what answers lead to which.

sub-aims are more concrete than aims, but the hypothesis is the yes/no question.

2nd order test of causality: tests how something happens, break something, and then fix it in a different way.

defining conceptual impact is difficult
