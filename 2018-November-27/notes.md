# Communicating to Different Audiences

- Think about your audience's needs
  - the shared article has a navigation bar to allow people to place themselves in the article.
  - links to primary scientific literature
  - conveys the confidence of the findings of the literature

- opening with a story ties you into the article.

- the spectrum article is a medium/deep dive article

- Should everyone be a science communicator (to the lay audience)?
  - probably not, but there are skills you can learn

- Tell a research story
  - dramatic arc
    - issue
    - complication
    - climax
    - resolution

- humanize your work, put it on the human scale (we can relate to it)
  - something you can see and touch
  - do not dumb it down, touch on the fundemental aspects without digging into the weeds

  - don't stretch a metaphor too far

  - be rhetorical
    - adjust to your audiences needs

RHET:7500 Science Communication in the digital age

start with anecdotes, but supplement with evidence (follow through with evidence)

Neuroscience Seminar:

- target the audience that knows the least in the room
- give rhetorical caveat that you can go into the weeds later

issue: cognitive decline
complication: diseases that are not alzhiemer's (building in the nuance to get to the gap)
climax: what my research does
resolution: how it fills/steps the gap

science is non-linear, so you can place your story pieces in a different order

where to start on personal statements?

- what do I have to convey? (think about your audience)
- who do I have to be?


source to publish lay writing:

- find the human source?
