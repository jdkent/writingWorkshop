# Grant Writing (Kristal Parker)

- use the resources from the granting agency
  - look at where you are applying
  - look at the grant announcement
  - don't be afraid to copy/paste from the online template
  - get samples from successful peers

- Have a great mentor
  - accountability (whether its a mentor or a partner!)
  - they are not competitive with you
  - change your password to something that will build you up

- Time Management
  - have timelines and have accountability partner watch it
  - Start MONTHS in advance.
  - Daily writing
  - think about when you will apply

- Book recommendation
  - How to Write a Lot

- Graphically represent Aims
  - box arrow diagrams

- Resources
  - COM-ScientificEditing@uiowa.edu
    - they have fellowship and grant templates

- Feedback
  - Keep the feedback loops short and frequent
  - give the aims to many people for feedback
  - don't have to incorporate all the feedback
  - time for feedback can take a week or two (or a day or two)
  - have to send your aims to your program officer
    - get a relationship with them by sending a cold email about your proposal
    - feedback on NIH guidelines, whether there is too much overlap with things
      that have already been funding
  - there is also a scientific review officer

- Figures
  - think about how your data will look for the grant
  - draft the figures (each figure has one concept)

- Training in grant
  - explicitly outline the training, who, how, when, how to evaluate

- DSP
  - give them materials at different timepoints
  - have to give them a budget
  - contact them to see what is necessary

- Fellowships
  - training plan weighed as much or more than the actual science
